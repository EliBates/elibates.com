				<p>
					I got started with computer technologies from a young age, and have been eager to learn my
					entire life. My first programming language was Visual Basic 6... I used this to make small
					games like tic-tac-toe many years ago.
				</p>
				<p>You could often find me in my teenage years tinkering with open source java games.</p>
				<p>
					I am currently a student, working part-time for a U.S.-based company tutoring in web
					development.
				</p>
				<p>I enjoy outdoor activities and am often spending my weekend's biking or traveling.</p>

		<p>
			I decided to pursue a degree in web development. However, the majority of my learning takes
			place during my own free time.
		</p>
		<q>
			The web and mobile computing major is about combining people and technology to bring out the
			best in both. In this web development degree students learn how to integrate the back end code
			with the front end user experience, and are able to do it across several languages and
			platforms, to impact the app design process at all levels. Students are highly valuable to
			employers seeking todayâ€™s most skilled application developers.
